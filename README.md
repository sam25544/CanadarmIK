# CanadarmIK
Prototype inverse kinematics system for Canadarm in KSP.

Notes:
- Depends on both KRPC (use this version: https://github.com/nullprofile/krpc/releases/tag/0.4.9-1.12.1) and KOS (Kos is used for part nametags to identify the joints.)
- To start the program, make sure the KRPC server is on and run the executable dist/script.exe.
- The joint name tags and rotations must be configured correctly, use the included subassembly for best results
- All joints must be unlocked for the script to be able to start.
- This implementation uses BG robotics.

This is a very rudimentary version and more of a proof-of-concept, although it is still helpful compared to stock robotics control. No warranty of any kind- kraken attacks and other issues are likely.
